    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set your oven to 180°C (350°F). Line a baking pan with baking paper or lightly grease it with butter.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a bowl (microwave or stovetop). Let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar to the melted butter and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla extract and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour and cocoa powder. Gently mix until just combined. Do not overmix, as this keeps the brownies fudgy.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into your prepared pan and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the top looks set but the center is still slightly soft.</li>
        <li>Let the brownies cool before cutting for cleaner slices.</li>
